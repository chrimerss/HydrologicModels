# HydrologicModels

This repository stores own-coded hydrologic models as well as some open access models (including land surface model)

We differentiate hydrologic model with land surface model by the primary purpose of its simulation. For instance, a hydrologic model inputs rainfall and outputs streamflow, while a land surface model focuses more on land states such as soil moisture, snow water equivelent, etc.
